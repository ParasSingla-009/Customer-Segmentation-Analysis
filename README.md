# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the Customer Segmentation Analysis project! This project aims to derive meaningful insights from large datasets to understand customer segments and predict customer churn. We utilized Python for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and various Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Efficiently extract large datasets from multiple sources.
- **Data Transformation**: Clean and preprocess data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- **Segmentation Analysis**: Identify distinct customer segments using clustering algorithms.
- **Churn Prediction**: Predict potential customer churn using machine learning models.
- **Visualization**: Generate insightful visualizations to represent the analysis results.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development and presentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of Python and data analysis.


## Usage

### Running the ETL Process

1. **Extract Data**
   - Extract data from the source using the scripts in the `extract` directory.

2. **Transform Data**
   - Run the transformation scripts in the `transform` directory to clean and preprocess the data.

3. **Load Data**
   - Load the cleaned data into the target database or data warehouse using the scripts in the `load` directory.

### Performing Customer Segmentation

1. **Segmentation Analysis**
   - Execute the segmentation scripts in the `segmentation` directory to identify customer segments.

2. **Churn Prediction**
   - Run the churn prediction models located in the `churn` directory to predict potential customer churn.

### Visualizing Results

1. **Generate Visualizations**
   - Use the visualization scripts in the `visualization` directory to create insightful charts and graphs.
